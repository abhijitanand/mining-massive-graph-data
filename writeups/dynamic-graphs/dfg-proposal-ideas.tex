%General intro to graphs and contemporary application domains
Graphs encode the interconnections between entities to model relations between them. They have proven to be an intuitive datastructure in modelling, querying and reasoning about real-life relationships. In websearch the graphs derived from links between webpages are used for link analysis and establishing authority of webpages. In social networks, the graph structure captures interesting insights about the influential nodes, community structures, connectivity and reachability etc. In biological networks people are interested in how diseases spread. In ontologies, they are useful to model taxonomies in the form of type hierarchies. Apart from these scenarios they find applications in road, water networks for shortest path computations and flow problems. 

% Evolving graphs and need for scoping out the area
Traditional research has focussed on largely on \emph{static graphs}. However, as one might quickly realize, most of the scenarios enumerated above have a evolutionary nature to them. Social networks, Web graphs, citation networks and even biological networks evolve over time. So there has been a growing need to support data management, querying, mining and analytics tasks over evolving or time-varying graphs.  Moreso, to date there is little work on understanding the challenges needed to ingest, manage and query such data in large graph databases. In this proposal we attempt to scope out the problems relating to dynamic graphs and more specifically time-varying graphs with an intent to identify open issues and problems which would be worth investigating.
