\label{wp:model}

\note{Points to be covered tentatively:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Structural analysis of large graphs like the evolving Web graphs. 

    \item Complementing previous analysis of graphs towards supporting models which help developing the practical semi-streaming models.

    \item Various design decisions based on such analysis.
\end{itemize}
