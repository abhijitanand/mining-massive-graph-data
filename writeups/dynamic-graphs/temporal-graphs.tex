\section{Temporal Graphs}
\label{sec:temporal-graphs}

% Our focus areas
We study dynamic graphs with a specific focus on three dimensions -- \emph{data or input models} for representing graphs, support for \emph{primitive operations} in querying and mining dynamic graphs, and finally data management issues pertaining to storing dynamic graphs for supporting \emph{approximate} and \emph{exact queries}.

\subsection{Dynamic Graph Input/Data Model}
\label{sec: data-model}

In this section we outline some of the prevalent data models in the literature pertaining to dynamic graphs. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\textbf{Streaming Model~\cite{muthukrishnan2005data} :}} The most prevalent and standard data model for dynamic graphs is the \emph{streaming model} which assumes the input to be a sequence edges from a given family of nodes. (cite Muthukrishnan et. al Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications). Here the algorithm sees the entire input and the typical assumption is of a limited working memory. 

%The relevant questions for such a model are : how d
	
	
	\item {\textbf{Dynamic Graph Model~\cite{demetrescu_algorithms_2010} :}} In this setting, a graph changes over time and the goal is to keep track of the changes so as to be able to efficiently answer graph queries. The main difference is that here when a change is performed to a graph, the algorithm is notified of the change.


	\item {\textbf{Property Testing Model~\cite{ron_algorithmic_2010} :}}  Here the goal is to find whether a graph has some property or is far from satisfying the property using a limited number of queries. 

	\item {\textbf{Multi-armed Bandit Model~\cite{muthukrishnan2005data} :}}  In the standard multi- armed bandit setting there are k slot machines (one-armed bandits) and pulling a lever in a slot machine gives a re- ward, which depends on the machine, and reveals informa- tion about the machine. The objective is to select the machines to query so as to maximize the total reward; as in our case, the number of queries in every time step is limited. 

	\item {\textbf{Fixed-probe Model~\cite{anagnostopoulos_algorithms_2012} :}} The time is assumed to proceed in discrete steps, numbered by positive integers. At each time step t, the data is given by a (possibly weighted) graph $G_t$. The data is changing gradually, i.e., the graph $G_{t+1}$ is obtained from $G_t$ by a small random change.2 At each time step $t$, the algorithm is allowed to probe a small portion of the graph Gt, and then must output a solution for the problem under consideration. We would like this solution to be close to the  \emph{correct} solution for the graph $G_t$. In this paper we do not impose any constraint on the amount of memory the algorithm maintains or the running time of the algorithm, although all of the algorithms we present are quite efficient with respect to these factors.

	\item {\textbf{Parametric optimization and kinetic problems~\cite{agarwal1998parametric} :}}In the parametric optimization model, the edge weights are known continuous functions of a real parameter $\lambda$ (often referred to as “time”), and the goal is to identify how the solution changes as $\lambda$ varies. A kinetic problem combines parametric optimizations and dynamic data structures for insertions and deletions. In such a problem, at the begin- ning a parametric problem of parameter $\lambda$ is given; as the time $\lambda$ progresses, the weight functions change and objects (e.g., edges) are inserted or deleted. The goal is to efficiently maintain the optimal solution at each point in time.
